                        <h1><strong>Hurricane</strong></h1>

                        Hurricanes are dangerous and can cause major damage because of storm surge, wind damamge, rip
                        currents and flooding.
                        They can happen along any U.S coast or in any territory in the Atlantic or Pacific ocean.
                        Storm surge is historically the leading cause of hurricane-related deaths in the United States.

                        Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem. Find out how rain, wind, water, even tornadoes could

                        <h4>Make an Emergency Plan</h4>

                        Make sure everyone in your household knows and understands your hurricane plan. In your
                        hurricane plans,
                        include the office, kids daycare, and anywhere you frequent visit. Ensure your business has a
                        continuity plan to

                        Keep your phone charged when you know a hurricane is in the forecast and purchase backup

                        devices to power electronics.

                        plans
                        to see how you can be of assistance to others.

                        <br>

                        <h4>Gather Supplies</h4>

                        Have enough supplies to your household, include medication, disinfectant supplies, masks, pet
                        supplies in your
                        go bag or car trunk. After a hurricane, you may not have access to these supplies for days or
                        even weeks.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Remember that not everyone can affors to respond by stocking up on necessities. For
                                those
                                who can afford it, making essential purchases and slowly building up supplies in advance
                                will
                                allow for longer time periods between shopping trips. This helps to protect those who
                                are unable
                                to procure essentials beforehand and must shop more frequently. Only take the items you
                                and your
                                family may need so that others who rely on these products can also access them.
